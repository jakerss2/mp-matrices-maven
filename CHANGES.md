The grader said all I had to do was fix style.

Quite literally, there was three things I changed.
I improperly documented the constructor. So I changed the name
fields to properly match the parameters. This was to fix the mvn checkstyle.
I also added my name to AssociativeArray, MatrixV0, and TestsByMe.
